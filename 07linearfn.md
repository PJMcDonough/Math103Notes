When we look to see if a function is increasing, we go from left to right. 
[Here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xcpdnt45b9), I provide an example of an increasing, decreasing and constant function (black, red and blue respectively).

Linear functions are functions of the form $y=mx+b$. Where 
$$m=\frac{\text{Rise(up)}}{\text{Run(right)}}$$
See the following [Desmos example](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ryaggxuc33) to play with $m$ and $b$.

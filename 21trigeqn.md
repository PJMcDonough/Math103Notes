% Trigonometric equations (ยง7.5)

There really isn't much new in this section, but the problems may be harder than what you are used to.
For this section, when I write $k$ I mean for every integer $k$.

#### Example
Find all values for $\theta$. Use radians.

\begin{align}
2\cos\theta-3&=-5\\
2\cos\theta&=-2\\
\cos\theta&=-1\\
\theta &= \pi +2\pi k
\end{align}


#### Example
Find all values for $\theta$. Use radians.

\begin{align}
\cos\theta&=\frac 12\\
\cos\theta&=\pm\frac\pi 3+2\pi k
\end{align}

#### Example
Find all values for $0\le\theta<2\pi$. Use radians.

\begin{align}
2\sin^2\theta-1&=0\\
\sin^2\theta&=\frac 12\\
\sin\theta&=\pm\frac{\sqrt 2} 2\\
\theta &= \frac 14 \pi, \frac 34 \pi, \frac 54 \pi, \frac 74 \pi,
\end{align}

Note that we should not write $\frac \pi 4 + \frac \pi 2 k$ because that would include to many solutions.

#### Example
Find $\theta$ using a calculator given $\sin\theta=.8$.
Clearly $\theta=\arcsin.8$ is a solution, but there are more.
The full list is $\arcsin.8+2\pi k, \pi-\arcsin.8+2\pi k$.
This can be seen by looking at a unit circle.

Plugging any of these solutions into a calculator is doable enough.
In particular, $\arcsin.8$ is approximately 53.13ยบ.

#### Example
Given $0\le\theta<2\pi$, solve $\cos 2\theta=\frac{\sqrt 3}2$.

**Solution:** Let $u=2\theta$. Then $0\le u <4\pi$. 
This means we have to look at two full revolutions.
In the first revolution the solutions are $u=\frac \pi 6, \frac {11\pi}6$.
In the second revolution, we have the other two solutions $u=\frac{13\pi}6, \frac{23\pi}6$.
So the solution is $\theta=\frac\pi {12}, \frac{11\pi}{12}, \frac{13\pi}{12}, \frac{23\pi}{12}$.

Some useful knowledge: sometimes linear equations are called degree 1 or first degree polynomial.
This is because, for whatever $x$ you give me, $x=x^1$, and therefore, we can write a linear equation as, say $y=mx^1+b$.

If you find the following confusing paragraph, and I don't blame you, try using the methods below to convince yourself that the $y$-intercept of $2x+3y=6$ is $2$ and the $x$-intercept is $3$.

It's generally quite easy to graph equations of the form $Ax+By=C$ with constants $A$, $B$, and $C$. 
In general we can find $x$-intercepts by setting $y=0$, and we can find $y$-intercepts by setting $x=0$
Some simple algebra shows that this give the $x$-intercept is $\frac{C}{B}$ and the $y$-intercept is $\frac{C}{A}$.
You could also convert to slope-intercept form ($y=mx+b$) as follows, and note the $y$-intercept is $b$ and the slope is $m$.
These will produce the same answer, and so will many other correct methods. 

If we want to we can put $2x+3y=6$ into point-slope form.
It turns out that this isn't the most efficient way of doing things, but we certainly can.
In fact there are multiple such point-slope equations.
The starred equations are examples of point-slope forms of the line.
$$\begin{align}
2x+3y&=6\\
3y &= 6 - 2x\\
y  &= 2 - \frac{2}{3} -x\\
y + 0 &= -\frac{-2}{3}(x-3)\\
\star\;y + 6 &= -\frac{-2}{3}(x-3) +6 \;\star\\
y + 6 &= -\frac{-2}{3}(x-3-4)\\
\star\;y + 6 &= -\frac{-2}{3}(x-3-4) \;\star\\
\end{align}$$

If we want to we can 


To graph something like $y-1=-3(x-2)$, note that it's point slope.
In this case the slope is $-3$ and the point is $(-2,1)$.
Remember that the formula has subtraction in it, so we have to flip the signs.

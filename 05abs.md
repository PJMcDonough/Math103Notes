"Part of the process of learning math is teaching yourself"

There are many equivalent ways of defining the absolute value, but the definition we consider to be the "real one" is the distance from zero.
This definition also makes sense in the context of complex numbers.
A common mistake is, to claim that given, $2\vert x\vert=14$ we can write $\vert x \vert = 7$ and then $x=7$.
Dividing by two is perfectly valid, but after that, we neglected the fact that $\vert -7\vert=7$, meaning that we have two solutions $x=7$ and $x=-7$.

If there is something about the problem that you find scary, you can isolate it. This will allow you to use more standard methods.

We can use absolute values in inequalities.
For example, $\vert x\vert\le 15$ means $-15\le x\le 15$ or $x$ is within $15$ of zero.
We can also say $\vert x\vert > 10$ to say that $x$ is more than $10$ away from zero.

When we solve an equation with an absolute value, we can rewrite it as two equations.
For example we can note the solutions are $\vert 3x-6\vert=9$ as the solution to $3x-6=9$ and the solution to $3x-6=-9$.
We need both rewritings.

It is important to note that $\vert x \vert = -1$ has no solutions, and the same is true of any negative number on the right hand side.
We can also say this as $\vert x\vert$ is always positive.

Frequently it's the mathematical language that trips people up, as opposed to the technique, algebra, or arithmetic.
If you are asked to find the zeros, or $x$-intercepts, of $f(x)$, that means to solve $f(x)=0$. 
Another way of saying this is that we set $y=0$.
For example to find the zeros of $f(x)=\vert 4x+1\vert -7$, we solve $\vert 4x+1\vert-7=0$.
We can do this by graphing, and noting the $x$ coordinates where $x$ crosses the $x$-axis.
We can also do this by adding $7$ to both sides giving $\vert 4x+1| =7$.
Therefor, either $4x+1=7$ or $4x+1=-7$, so $4x=6$ or $4x=-8$.
By dividing by $4$ we get two solutions $x=\frac{3}{2}$ and $x=-2$.
To find the $y$-intercept, simply evaluate $f(0)$.
This means, in other words, set x=0.

Here's a final example. The goal is to solve $-\frac{1}{2}\vert 4x-5\vert < -3$.
Not that this does in fact have solutions.
Don't let the negative numbers fool you.
When we multiply both sides of the inequlity by $-2$, we must switch the direction of the inequality giving $\vert 4x-5\vert>(-3)(-2)$.
Whe do this whenever we multipy or divide by a negative number.
We've got a good justification for this: if you don't remember what to do when you multiply by $-1$, simply subtract the left hand side from each side, then subtract the right hand side from each side.
What you've done is equivilent to multiplying by $-1$.
To solve this we change it to an equation (but we have to remember that we've done that).
We solve the equation $\vert 4x-4\vet =6$ giving $4=\frac{11}{4},{-1}{4}$.
These are called the critical points.
At this point, we draw ourselves a numberline and pick a point in each of the three sections of the numberline we have seperated with our two points.
We can plug these numbers into the original inequality to get answers for all points in those sections.
This gives us $x>\frac{11}{4}$ or $x<\frac{-1}{4}$.
Note that we cannot write this as $\frac{11}{4}<x< \frac{-1}{4}$.

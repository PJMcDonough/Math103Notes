Consider the example of inflation.
Let's consider Phil's function for how much things will cost in a year given 7.5% inflation.
By the definition of percent inflation, we have $p(x)=x+.075x$, which we can rewrite as $p(x)=1.075x$.
The $y$-intercept is $0$ which means that stuff not being free anymore isn't inflation.

Tutoring Center:

- Consider visiting the [tutoring center](https://www.csuci.edu/learningresourcecenter/lrconlinetutoring.htm). We're there to help.
- There is no time limit.
- We are free and 

Logistics:

 - Please show up. This is important.
 - Read the [syllabus](https://cilearn.csuci.edu/courses/20022/assignments/syllabus). These notes are not a substitute for the syllabus. You should probably read the syllabi from all your other classes.
 - The textbook is a free PDF, or you could by a hard copy for something like 30 bucks.
 - MyOpenMath (MOM) is built into Canvas now, and is connected to your gradebook.
 - Note that the Final is 8-10am. This is earlier than all the other weeks.
 - You should register for the support course Math 98. This will give you +2% overall on your grade, or see the professor about an alternative. This will usually move you up a grade e.g., removing a "-" or adding a "+". It is hosted at the same Zoom link as this class.
 - In order to go on to the next topic you must view everything that says view. Once you've done this, it will say view**ed**.

Course Philosophy:

- "Mathematics seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures". This is apparently a common quote. It's also true.
- Math is not just about numbers. It's a playground.
- Some people see a spiritual aspect in math. The professor cites Ramanujan's beliefs here, but I am partial to Feynman's.

Group Work:

- Group work just looks like psychobabble. It actually works, like really well. They've done studies.
- We have discussions. Please post to them. If you like you can post just questions, and get full credit. You can also get credit for answers. 

Homework:

- Please do it.
- The reason it exists is to help you learn.
- To get 100% credit on the homework, you only need to complete 90% of the problems.
- If you do more than 90% you will get more than 100% on that category. This is a really strong curve.
- The grade adjustment is note made until the end of the semester.

Curves:

- There are no large curves except for the thing about homework, or if the professor thinks a test was poorly designed and no one gets a good score.

Three Truths and a Lie:

1. Zoom likes to Misspell my last name.
2. I am in a choir.
3. I am a CS major not a math Major.
4. I dropped Calc II at Moorpark College.

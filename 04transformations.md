We have some rules for transformations of functions.
When reviewing this, you may want to try graphing yourself.

Consider an arbitrary function $f(x)$ and some arbitrary constant number $k$.

* The function $f(x)$ shifted up by $k$ is $f(x)+k$.
* The function $f(x)$ shifted down by $k$ is $f(x)-k$.
* The function $f(x)$ shifted to the right by $k$ is $f(x-k)$.
* The function $f(x)$ shifted to the left by $k$ is $f(x+k)$.
* The function $f(x)$ flipped about the $x$-axis is $-f(x)$.
* The function $f(x)$ flipped about the $y$-axis is $f(-x)$.
* The function $f(x)$ stretched vertically by a factor of $k$ is $kf(x)$.
* The function $f(x)$ stretched horizontally by a factor of $k$ is $f(\frac{x}{k})$.
* The function $f(x)$ squashed vertically by a factor of $k$ is $\frac{f(x)}{k}$.
* The function $f(x)$ squashed horizontally by a factor of $k$ is $f(kx)$.

Note that for some transformations, the $k$ is outside the $()$, and for others, it's inside.
The professor provides a bunch of examples in his video, that I can't reproduce here.

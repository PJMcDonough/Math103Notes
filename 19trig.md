# ยง5.1 Angles
We frequently use the following Greek Letters for angle names in trigonometry.

|Letter| Name|
|-----|-----|
|$\theta$ | theta|
|$\phi$ | phi|
|$\alpha$ | alpha|
|$\beta$ | beta|
|$\gamma$ | gamma|

We will be discussing angle between rays.
A ray is 

Standard Position is when we place the angle at the origin, and align the initial (AB of ABC) side with the $x$-axis pointing in the $+x$ direction.
The other ray (BC of ABC) is the is terminal side.
Positive angles are counter-clockwise.

In addition to the normal degree system, we also use radians.
The two most useful conversions are $90ยบ=\frac 12\pi$ in radians, and $360ยบ=2\pi$.
A radian is the angle you get when you rap a string with the length of the radius of a circle around a cure and connect the outer point to the center to the other outer point on the at the other end of the string

Choosing 360ยบ is not a bad choice at all, because it allows for simple divisibility, but it also has disadvantages compared to radians.

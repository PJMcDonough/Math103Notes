The average rate of change (ARC) is usually written as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, which we define as $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.
The average rate of change is also called the slope, but the name average rate of change is used more frequently in application
The $x$- and $y$-values are taken from two points, and we must be consistent which point is which.
We also write ARC as $\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$ when we want to find the ARC between two points on a function.
We can also take the average rate of change over some closed interval $[a,b]$ for a given function $g$.
This just means the ARC between the points $(a,g(a))$ and $(b,g(b))$.
This is $\frac{g(b)-g(a)}{b-a}$.
Frequently a question will require you to do some simplification after that.


Don't be scared off by the use of variables rather than specific numbers.
They can absolutely be scary, but once you jump in, you can get rather nice answers.
You can follow the same procedures as you would if you were given numbers.

## Local minima and maxima
An absolute maximum is the highest point on the graph.
The requirement for a local max is weaker.
If you can put a window (technical term neighborhood), around a point and its the largest value in the window, then its the local maximum.
There are analogous definitions for minima.
Absolute minima and maxima are local minima and maxima as well, but not all local maxima and minima are absolute maxima and minima (both respectively).

## Determine where a function is increasing or decreasing
Always evaluate left to right. Evaluating right to left will swap increasing and decreasing.

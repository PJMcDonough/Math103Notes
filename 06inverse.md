It makes sense mnemonically to think of these of these as undoing functions.
Consider the function $f(x)=2x$ which is of course the doubling function.
To undo it, we use the undoubling  function.
When we want to notate an inverse function of $f$ we write $f^{-1}$.
So, we have $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{2}$.
Graphically we can think of this as reflecting about the 

Condiser the following method for finding the function $f^{-1}$ given $f$.

1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$
2. Swap $x$ aned $y$.
3. Solve for $y$
4. Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$

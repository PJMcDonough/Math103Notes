<p>When we look to see if a function is increasing, we go from left to
right. <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xcpdnt45b9">Here</a>,
I provide an example of an increasing, decreasing and constant function
(black, red and blue respectively). Make sure to go left to right. If
you say, “oh it goes up and to the left”, you’ll get the problem wrong,
because it goes down and to the right.</p>
<p>Linear functions are functions of the form <span
class="math inline">\(y=mx+b\)</span>. Where <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is slope and</p>
<p>See the following <a
href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ryaggxuc33">Desmos example</a>
to play with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[m=\frac{\text{Rise (i.e. up)}}{\text{Run (i.e.
right)}}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\]</span>
The slope can have interpretable units. For example, <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> may be a speed. If you drive at a
constant speed for 6 hours, and go 420 miles, you will find your speed
as <span class="math display">\[\frac{\Delta \text{Distance}}{\Delta
\text{Time}}=\frac{420\mathrm{mi}}{6\mathrm{h}}=70\mathrm{\frac{mi}{h}}=70\mathrm{mph}\]</span>
If you do it upside down, you will see your answer is wrong because the
units will be for pace rather than speed (this is like what runners mean
say when they say 10 minute mile pace).</p>
<p>We have a general formula for the slope . <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are taken to be any ______ on the line,
and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> are the coordinates of the point we
are interested in. We can algebra this to the final equation below which
is known as point-slope form. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
m = \frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}\\
m(x-x_1)=y-y_1\\
y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Consider the line defined by the points <span
class="math inline">\((-1,-8)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((4,2)\)</span>. We want a formula for the line in
point-slope form. We can find the slope of the line using the defining
formula above, and plug that into the point-slope form. Note that we can
chose either point for this, but to show you how we didn’t do it in
class, I’ll chose to do it this way. I performed all the substitutions
in one step, and wrote <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> instead of
<span class="math inline">\(--\)</span>, but the calculation is
equivalent to the professor’s work. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align}
y+8&amp;=\frac{2+8}{4-1}(x+1)\\
y+8&amp;=2(x+1)\\
y+8&amp;=2x+2\\
y&amp;=2x-6\\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The neat thing about slope-intercept form is that the intercept <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the y coordinate of the line when it
intersects with the y axis. We can see this because <span
class="math inline">\(0m+b=b\)</span>. This makes graphing easier.</p>
<p>Here’s another example: Find an linear equation with slope of <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> that passes through the point <span
class="math inline">\((6,-1)\)</span>. We can just write <span
class="math inline">\(y+1=3(x-6)\)</span>. I just read that off; no math
work required. We <em>don’t</em> need to convert that to slope-intercept
form, but if we were asked to, or we didn’t read the problem carefully,
we would distribute and solve for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
giving <span class="math inline">\(y=3x-19\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> Copying things is hard. Up two this point
on this <em>webpage</em>, I made two mathematical copying errors that I
had to go back and fix. Mr. West had a student who thought she was just
terrible at math, and so didn’t really apply herself. She took a basic
algebra class apathetically, and got around 25%. Next time she worked
hard, and went to office hours every week. Mr. West noticed that her
errors were mostly copying errors. In his mind this was not a good
thing, but she realized that her problem wasn’t math. Once she knew what
was tripping her up she felt much better and her grade improved. She got
81% on final he got a bit emotional about it. With all the work she did,
he really wanted her to pass.</p>
<p>More examples are always good. Take a look at this one. Find a linear
equation that goes through points <span
class="math inline">\((5,1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((8,7)\)</span>. It’s a good idea to sketch this,
but when I’m typing sketching is hard, so just imagine I did. Using the
formula for slope and point-slope form, we get <span
class="math inline">\(y-1=\frac{8-5}{7-1}(x-5)\)</span>. If we wanted to
simplify, we could rewrite this as <span
class="math inline">\(y-1=2(x-5)\)</span></p>
